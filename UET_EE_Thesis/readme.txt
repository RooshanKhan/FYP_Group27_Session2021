

This "readme.txt" file is a brief description on how to work with this template.

The UET_EE_Thesis_Latex_Template folder when unzipped, contains the following 
files and folders:

1) uet_thesis.tex -- This is the main file. It includes the information about the 
		     cover page(s). It also includes the chapters and refrences.


2) uet_thesis.cls -- This is the class file controlling the style of the thesis. 
		     It SHOULD NOT be edited/changed under any circumstances.


3) uet_thesis.bbl -- This is the bibliography file generated automatically. Do not 
		     edit this file.  
		     

4) refrences.bib -- All the refrences that you want to include will go in to this file.
		    To ensure correct/consistent format, copy the citations obtained
  		    from Google Scholar. To do this, open the Google Scholar 
		    webpage. Click on the link 'Scholar Preferences'. Look for 
		    'Bibliography Manager' at the end of the page. There, CHECK the 
		    option 'Show links to import citations into' and select 'BibTex'
		    from the drop down menu. Whenever you add a new reference you need 
		    update the bibliography file by executing the 'BibTex' command.   



5) uet_thesis.pdf -- This is the final result when you compile the latex source 
		     code of 'uet_thesis.tex'. Make sure you always compile 
		     'uet_thesis.tex'.


6) Chapters -- 	This folder contains different chapters you will write in the 
	       	thesis. Currently only two chapters are included. When you add a 
		new chapter, let's say chapter 3, include it in the 'uet_thesis.tex'
		file as well.

7) Figures -- 	This folder contains all the figures that have been used in the 
		chapters. The figures can be of type '.pdf', '.jpg', '.tiff' and 
		some other types as well. Fo details see the appendix of the thesis 
		template.
